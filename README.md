# #30DayMapChallenge 🌎🌏🌎

## Introduction

Welcome to my #30DayMapChallenge repository! This project is a daily social mapping challenge happening every November. The challenge encourages participants to create maps based on different themes each day and share them using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge.

This repo contains my submissions for the #30DayMapChallenge of 2023. I'll add my work daily throughout the month of November.

## Themes

Here are the themes for each day of the challenge in 2023:

## Code of Conduct

No matter if you are a GIS expert or have never made a map before, everyone is welcome to participate. Please keep in mind the following:

- All maps you publish must be your original work. Do not steal content from others.
- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.
- The challenge is all about creativity, openness, and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography. It is not a competition.
- Be respectful and considerate to fellow participants. Don't be unkind.
